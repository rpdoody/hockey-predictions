    Calculate expected goals blending aggregate stats with NHL shot-quality analytics.

    When NHL team analytics data is available (xGF, xGA per game derived from
    the NHL stats REST API ``team/analytics`` endpoint), this model blends those
    shot-quality adjusted figures with the legacy goals-per-game model at a
    configurable ratio.

    The blend leans on analytics whenever data quality is high.  A team with
    high Fenwick% but modest goal numbers is likely being unlucky; the analytics
    signal captures that.  Conversely, a team with weak analytics but strong
    goal totals is likely running hot.
